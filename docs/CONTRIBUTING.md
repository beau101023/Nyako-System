# Contributing

1. Pull requests are welcomed! Before submitting, make sure your pull request is either very small or clearly commented/documented. It's crucial that reviewers can understand what your pull request is doing. Updating any relevant documentation along with your pull request is highly appreciated!

2. The codebase's style is to type hint parameters, return types, and variables wherever possible. For other matters of style, the [Ruff linter and formatter](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) as configured by [ruff.toml](/ruff.toml) is the source of truth.

# Contributing

Contributors should be aware of the following guidelines:

1. The codebase's style is to strictly type hint all parameters, return types, and variables. For other matters of style, the [Ruff linter and formatter](ruff.toml) is the source of truth.

2. Pull requests are welcomed, but they should be either atomic or *clearly* documented. It is important that all maintainers can read and understand changes to the codebase.
